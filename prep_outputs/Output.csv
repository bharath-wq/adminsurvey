After asking for quick feedback about my decline simply to confirm if it was automatic like I suspected, I was advised to resubmit my application. After this resubmission, I did in fact get in for the original term, which I appreciated; I was just a bit hurt by the initial decision after my very strong undergraduate performance here at Purdue and, in my opinion, already clarifying the points of concern with my application with admissions staff. Additionally, IU Kelley's program had twice the number of prerequisites but not only accepted my application on the first go around, trusting me to wrap the remaining coursework up in a timely manner, they also offered me over $15K in scholarships / assistantships / salary as a graduate teaching assistant. Purdue's offer said no such positions are available to professional master's students. Finally, when thinking about longer term career planning, I do believe IU is more well-known for accounting than Purdue, and I ideally did want to go somewhere different for my undergrad / grad degrees to get additional diversity in my educational experience.

Previously, my family and I have planned to finance the expenses for my Masters in the USA through the money from my father's pension and provident fund(s), sale of assets and other savings. However,  during this pandemic there is little chance of being able to accumulate adequate cash to cover the expense of the program. My father is a government service holder, retiring by the end of 2020, but if this situation continues there is low possibility for the local government to provide the pension payments any time soon.On the other hand, the economy in trembling in here, the demand (and price) of real estate and other assets has been falling rapidly, and large transaction/withdrawals from personal accounts are discouraged (and somewhat restricted) by the government (especially for the government employees) .
Thus, keeping everything under consideration I will be unable to go for and/or start to pursue the Masters' program at your university this Fall-2020.

Some personal reasons were involved in my decision such as the fact that my long-time girlfriend will be attending school in LA and I have family in the area. The program at USC is shorter which is something that appealed to me and includes an experiential trip to Singapore where students carry out a project. Another factor was the school's diversity and the demographics related to international students which were higher at USC. I think both schools are amazing options for this program and my decision was more based on personal reasoning than on academic preferences.

I guess most students made decisions depending on schools' strong advantages instead of making sure all things are at average level, so two or three attractive factors such as career services would be important.

Overall, in terms of academics, Purdue is a perfect place. Almost all the faculty members here are very supportive during my undergraduate life, except one faculty Wei Zaiyan. I learn nothing from his tableau course because he provides nothing for us to refer to after the class. (only demonstrate one time in lecture, no book, no video, not helpful course material).  He is too busy to teach. This also makes me think that I might get a similar experience in the MS program if I met similar professors.

Also it has powerful network here in South Korea. So, Purdue has its name value when it comes to people who is older than 40 years.
However, new generation do not know well about the strength point of purdue because purdue do not participate in Asia Tour or Fair unlike other universities.
I watched a lot of promotion pop up advertisement in the web site. But It is not so effective when it comes to applicant's decision because people can't know the details of program through the web site and usually ignore the pop up message.
I think it will be a good option to promote purdue program if admission committe member or student consultant participate in MBA Aisa(including South Korea) Tour or Fair.

Thank you for your offer of admission. Although it was a very difficult decision, I have decided to enroll instead at the University of San Francisco. One key reason for my choice is that the Data Science program at USF provides an opportunity for 9 months internship. Although your BAIM program is excellent and equally competitive, the opportunity of 9 months practicum won me over in the end. Another factor was the location in San Francisco, closer to my home in Southern California. 

I am grateful for the consideration you gave my application and for the opportunity to join your Class of 2018-2019. I really enjoyed the conversation with Andreea during my interview and I am deeply impressed by the growth of the program. I would also like to give special thanks to Andreea for answering my questions along the interview and providing me deep insights about the BAIM program.

Thank you again!

Sincerely, 
Bowen",,,,Master of Science in Data Science ,,,,,,,"['University of San Francisco', ' Duke', ' Emory', ' UC LOS ANGELES', ' UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA', ' UC SAN DIEGO', ' SOUTHERN METHODIST UNIVERSITY']"

When I went through the process there was four different reasons why I choose not to attend Purdue.  Class and semester structure where the first two.  The semester at Purdue is seven and a half weeks long and that is a very short amount of time to cram as much information in as possible.  I am accustomed to semesters being fifteen weeks long and I was worried about the pace of the program and setting myself up for failure if this pace was too fast.
  
I also didn’t like that class where asynchronous or not live.  While I wanted the flexibility of online, I wanted live sessions with a set day and time.  It keeps your week on track and makes you be accountable for your schedule. Third reason was program ranking.  The institution I selected to attend was ranked higher top to bottom for supply chain.

Fourth reason was how established the program was.  It was clear early on that Purdue is still building this program and they were open about this.  Not only how its structured but also how they engage with prospective students.  While I was able to touch base with an Assistant Director of Recruiting and they answered any questions I had, they never reached out to actively pursue me as a potential student.

The institution I selected reached out multiple times asking if I had additional questions, assist in any way to make the application process easier.  They also had a virtual open house where I got to meet current students and facility and staff.  Finally, when I was accepted into the school and program, they not only sent me a letter but called me to welcome me to the university and the program.  It was the small personal touches like that really made it feel like they went above and beyond and really valued you and you weren’t just another another number in a seat.

The main reason for my withdrawing admittance is that I wish to attend a program that will have me graduate after July, 2023, while unfortunately the MSBAIM program is not extendable for the 2022-2023 cohort. Because many companies in China have rigid requirements for students' graduation dates, graduating from the MSBAIM program in May will inevitably have me miss many Chinese companies' recruitment season for 2023. Although my priority goal is to seek employment in the US, I do wish to maintain some flexibility with a backup plan to be eligible for Chinese companies' recruitment. Therefore I have to seek another program with a duration that better matches my job search plans.

I know that Krannert and Purdue would constitute a marvelous platform for my future studies and professional development. I am sorry about forgoing the opportunity to join you because of my limits.",Asian,,Yes,,,,,,,,['']
